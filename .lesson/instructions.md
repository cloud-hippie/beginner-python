# Instructions

This is the official repo for the String chapter on CloudHippie.com.

## How to use this Repo

Each Cloud Classroom project comes with a `repl.it` project.

Each repo has a `Lessons` folder containing the code from the Video attached to the chapter.

Some repos will have a `Lab` folder. This indicates they have an assignment attached.

You complete the coding challenges by getting all of the tests to pass.

This is a very real world example of how software is developed.

## Steps
  1. If you have not used CloudClassroom, Watch the Introduction Video.
  2. Navigate to the panel on the right.
  3. Run `python NAME_OF_YOUR_SCRIPT.
